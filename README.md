# Hi, I’m Kopal 👋✨

I’m a Computer Science graduate who loves building clean, scalable software and exploring how AI can solve real-world problems. I enjoy working across backend systems, APIs, and modern full stack applications, with a growing focus on AI-driven systems and LLM-based workflows.

I believe good engineering is a balance of logic, structure, and curiosity — and I like building things that actually work in production.
